				<h3>OSU Cascades </h3>
				<p>OSU Cascades is situated in Bend, OR and is a relatively new college with an even newer Computer Science program. They primarily focus on Web & Mobile Devlopment (And will offer internship oppurtunities through MECOP & their professional program), more advanced degree options are offered at their parent school: OSU.</p>
				<p>While OSU Cascades does not offer a graduate program themselves, their parent school OSU offers both Masters and PHD level work. Degrees are offered specializing in Theoretical Comp Sci, Artificial Intelligence, Computer Systems, Programming Languages, Software Engineering, and Computer Vision and Graphics. </p>
				<p>A particularly interesting area of research being done by OSU includes AI and robotics. Their research in AI has been used in forest fire management, species conservation, emergency response, and agriculture, while their robotics research has been used in making intelligent wheel chairs, ocean exploration, along with various medical and agricultural applications.</p>
				<h4>B.S. with Web & Mobile Development option</h4>

				<h3>Indiana University Bloomington</h3>
				<p>Indiana University Bloomington is located in Bloomington, Indiana. They are a massive university oferring degrees and research in quite a few areas. Some of these areas include: System, hardware and robotics design, theory of computing, algorithms, and applied logic, high-performance computiung, cybersecurity, graphics and visualizations, programming languages and compilers, artificial intelligence and cognitive science, distributed and parallel systems, database and information systems, computer networks and security, and bioinformatics.</p>
				<p>Internships are offered through their professional program. The research they have been performing into cybersecurity has been more of an applied practice, looking into real-world scenarios - as such their work has been used to greatly benefit the industry as a whole. Although not many more details than that have been given on their website. </p>
				<h4>B.S. with Cybersecurity option</h4>
