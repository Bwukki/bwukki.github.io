				<ol start="9" type="1"> <li>In the software world, what does “slippage” mean?</li>
				</ol><p><i>Lateness</i></p>
				
				<ol start="10" type="1"> <li>Fredrick Brooks was a programming manager for what software project?</li>

				<ol start="15" type="1"> <li>What is the difference between source code and the program you install (.exe) on your computer?</li>
				</ol><p><i>Source code is the human written code used to design the program, with it you can tinker and change things. The .exe on your computer is simply a binary file full of machine code that would be near-impossible for a human to understand.</i></p>
				
				<ol start="16" type="1"> <li>What is the one “article of faith” that all “open source” or “free” software advocates share?</li>

				<ol start="18" type="1"> <li>Eric Raymond’s book “<a href="http://www.catb.org/esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/">The Cathedral and the Bazaar</a>” made a distinction between two important project development ideas, briefly contrast them.</li>
				</ol><p><i>One idea is to build software as you would a cathedral, a small group working carefully and perhaps in isolation. The other style was to release early and often while being totally open.</i></p>
				
				<ol start="19" type="1"> <li>Has “open source” software project development refuted Brooks’s “mythical man-month” concerns?</li>
				</ol><p><i>Kind of, it introduced “linus’s law” which says “given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow” and the counter point “Provided the development coordinatior has a communications medium at least as good as the internet, and knows how to lead without coercion, many heads are inevitably better than one.”</i></p>
				
				<ol start="20" type="1"> <li>What was <a href="http://andy.hertzfeld.usesthis.com/">Andy Hertzfeld</a>’s input when the Chandler project appeared to have stalled?</li>
				</ol><p><i>“The key is getting exciting work going; the rest of it will take care of itself”</i></p>
				
				<p><b>Chapter 2</b></p>
				
				<ol start="1" type="1"> <li>What was the lifetime as a supported product, of Lotus 123? When did Kapor walk away from it? Why did he walk away from it?</li>
				</ol><p><i>Until about the 1990s. He left after protests started happening about Lotus’s business and copyright practices. He walked away because he sympathized with open-source ideals. </i></p>
				
				<ol start="2" type="1"> <li>What does it mean for a program to “fork?”</li>
				</ol><p><i>When there is a disagreement development can split into rival camps</i></p>
				
				<ol start="3" type="1"> <li>Linus Torvalds used a “science” and “witchcraft” analogy referring to software, explain.</li>
				</ol><p><i>Science means building upon the work of others (open source), witchcraft means guarding a small secret without sharing it (traditional software)</i></p>
				
				<ol start="4" type="1"> <li>Who, where, when demonstrated one of the first PIM software programs?</li>
				</ol><p><i> “oNLine System” (NLS) – created by Engelbart and demonstrated in 1968 at the San Francisco Convention Center. </i></p>
				
				<ol start="5" type="1"> <li>People often refer to starting their computer as “booting” their computer. What was the origin of this term?</li>
				</ol><p><i>The phrase “pulling oneself up by the bootstraps”</i></p>
				
				<ol start="6" type="1"> <li>Where was the graphical user interface (GUI) developed?</li>
				</ol><p><i>Xerox’s Palo Alto Research center</i></p>
				
				<ol start="7" type="1"> <li>List three software project “train wrecks.”</li>
				</ol><p><i>“Trilogy” by the FBI, The Federal Aviation Administration’s Advanced Automation System, and the Pentagon’s “Future Combat System”</i></p>

				<a href="http://www.drdobbs.com/architecture-and-design/the-non-existent-software-crisis-debunki/240165910">http://www.drdobbs.com/architecture-and-design/the-non-existent-software-crisis-debunki/240165910</a></li>
				</ol><p><i>Widely cited past reports about the failures of software ventures is greatly exaggerated and not as bleak as reported.</i></p>
				
				<ol start="9" type="1"> <li>Scan down this article to the two conclusions (about eight paragraphs down). With two sentences, what is your take away from this?<br />
				<a href="http://scribblethink.org/Work/Softestim/softestim.html">http://scribblethink.org/Work/Softestim/softestim.html</a></li>
				</ol><p><i>It may be very difficult to provide an exact objective prediction of the time required to develop a piece of software, but estimation is possible. However, we need to realize our shortcomings and acknowledge that we cannot say for certain and may be way off. </i></p>
				
				<p><b>Chapter 3</b></p>
				
				<ol start="1" type="1"> <li>Keep track of team members: 2001 --&gt; Mitch Kapor, Morgen Sagen, Al Cho, Andy Hertzfeld</li>
				</ol><p><i>Hertzfeld had left apple, Kapor had done time as a DJ, Sagen and Cho did some research on data structures.</i></p>
				
				<ol start="2" type="1"> <li>When introducing a new technology or design, why did Frederick Brooks advise “plan to throw one away?”</li>
				</ol><p><i>Because you’re unlikely to get it right the first time.</i></p>
				
				<ol start="3" type="1"> <li>2002, Katie Parlante joined Chandler. When she first joined what did she do? </li>
				</ol><p><i>Researched user behavior patterns.</i></p>
				
				<ol start="4" type="1"> <li>John Anderson joined Chandler as “systems architect.” Briefly, what did that mean?</li>
				</ol><p><i>He oversaw the tools the programmers would use.</i></p>
				
				<ol start="5" type="1"> <li>What is a “core” dump? Why the use of the word core?</li>
				</ol><p><i>A computer stopping everything its doing and outputting a file of its memory. Because some of the earliest computers were built out of wire coils aka ferrite cores.</i></p>
				
				<ol start="6" type="1"> <li>How did Erik Sink, speaking of abstractions, describe what programmers do?</li>
				</ol><p><i>He described programmers work as building piles of abstractions, designing our own abstractions and then pile them on top of layers we got from somebody else.</i></p>
				
				<ol start="7" type="1"> <li>Rather than writing program statements in binary code, 110101110 1001101111, programmers developed a shorthand language called what?</li>
				</ol><p><i>Assembly language</i></p>
				
				<ol start="8" type="1"> <li>Adding layers of abstraction, new programming languages were created: Lisp, Cobol, Algol, Basic. Fortran was the first widely used. What kind of program converted Fortran to binary?</li>
				</ol><p><i>A compiler.</i></p>
				
				<ol start="9" type="1"> <li>What are the implications behind: “...there is no <a href="http://www.mooreslaw.org/">Moore’s Law</a> for software. Chips may double in capacity every year or two; our brains don’t.”?</li>
				</ol><p><i>The programmer’s time becomes more and more valuable compared to the computer’s processing power. It may not always be worthwhile to be as efficient as possible managing small bits of computational power.</i></p>
				
				<ol start="10" type="1"> <li>The language selected for Chandler was <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a>. What does it mean that Python was an interpreted language?</li>
				</ol><p><i>When the program is run the source code is translated line by line. </i></p>
				
				<ol start="11" type="1"> <li>The <a href="http://seclists.org/interesting-people/2002/Oct/83">announcement of Chandler</a> occurred when? (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20030504050437/http:/www.riehle.org/vuw-mirror/CS-TR-02-9.pdf">Interesting Paper</a>) <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20021021082601/http:/slashdot.org/">Slashdot page from 2002</a>.</li>
