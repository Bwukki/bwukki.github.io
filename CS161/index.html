				<h1>Curtis Michels' CS160-162 Portfolio</h1>
				<img src="avatar.jpg" alt="avatar">
				<p>Welcome to my Github!</p>
				<p>This is my portfolio for my CS161 class. </p>
				<p>Introduction:</p>
				<p>I have minor experience programming in c# and mIRC many years ago. Since then the only real experience I've gotten is from my CS160 course I took with Peter Casey last term.</p>
				<p>Currently I am pursuing an Associate of Oregon Transfer Degree in computer science. I plan on eventually transferring to OSU Cascades to complete a bachelors. However, I am currently considering switching majors to either math or physics.</p>
				<p>Below are links to all of the exercises/assignment assigned during this course, split up by the week they were assigned.</p>
				<li><a href="/CS161/week1.html">Week 1 Exercises</a></li>
				<li><a href="/CS161/week2.html">Week 2 Exercises</a></li>
				<li><a href="/CS161/week3.html">Week 3 Exercises</a></li>
