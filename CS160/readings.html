				<h1>Curtis Michels' CS160 Reading questions!</h1>
				<h2>Dreaming in code:</h2>
				<h3>Overarching Themes:</h3>
				<h4>Pay attention / record the various roles that software engineers have on the Chandler Project.</h4>
			<p><i>Lots of programmers. At least one person doing systems architecture and one researching user behavior.</i></p>
			<h4>Pay attention / record the many scheduling issues related to Chandler Project.</h4>
			<p><i>Trouble getting started, trouble making decisions, trouble making decisions quickly, no clear leadership since it was based on consensus, no deadlines and perhaps a lack of motivation.</i></p>

															<ol start="2" type="1"> <li>Was structured programming a solution to the problem of software development?</li>
															</ol><p><i>Not exactly, but it helped lay the foundation for good practices and did help.</i></p>
															
															<ol start="3" type="1"> <li>Have any techniques shown to improve the software development process?</li>
															</ol><p><i>It seems to be highly debated (for instance whether you should plan a lot vs plan less) so there doesn’t seem to be a definite answer thus far.</i></p>
															
															<ol start="4" type="1"> <li>The “waterfall model” of programming was/is popular. What were some problems with this model?</li>
															</ol><p><i>Programmers would not be able to work until certain stages were complete, start working before they got the requirements, difficulties meshing huge chunks of code together at the end of the project, delays, confusion, general mayhem and bedlam.</i></p>
															
															<ol start="5" type="1"> <li>What are the four tenets of Agile Software Development?</li>

															<ol start="7" type="1"> <li>What is the “Joel Test” and what did he say about Microsoft and the Joel Test.</li>
															</ol><p><i>The ‘Joel Test’ is a set of principles to figure out whether or not a particular organization has their act together. The questions are as follows:“Do you use source control? Can you make a build in one step? Do you make daily builds? Do you have a bug database? Do you fix bugs before writing new code? DO you have an up-to-date schedule? Do you have a spec? Do programmers have quiet working conditions? Do you use the best tools money can buy? Do you have testers? Do new candidates write code during their interview? Do you do hallway usability testing?</i></p>

								<p>1. Briefly describe the four gates explained in Chapter 11. Describe the behavior of each gate based on the input values to the gate.</p>
								
								<p><i>The first gate is an “and” gate, and will output a voltage only if all inputs have a voltage. The second is an “or” gate which will output a voltage if any of its inputs carry a voltage. The third is a “nand” gate, which will output a voltage unless all inputs carry a voltage. Finally we have a “nor” gate, which will output a voltage only if all inputs carry no voltage.</i></p>

								<p>There are at least two methods of writing code, both according to this article and my own personal experience. One method of course being the quick and dirty “get it out the door” technique, with the other being a slower yet more robust strategy. I do believe that there is a time and place for each, and which one you should choose depends entirely on the circumstances of your work. </p>
								
								<p>Let’s consider a few different scenarios where we can pick and choose our plan of attack to maximize the strengths of each technique when appropriate. Imagine you’re writing a piece of software for your own personal use. Perhaps it’s something that will automate your work to some extent or just a nifty tool. What should we use and why? To determine that we can look at a number of factors: </p>
								
								<ol start="1" type="1"> <li>Who is going to be using the program? </li>
								<li>How large will the program grow?</li>
								<li>What are our needs for updating/maintaining the code?</li>
								<li>What could go wrong? </li>
								</ol><p>The program is purely for our benefit, so we can presume we’re going to be the only ones using it. This means we don’t need to sanitize our inputs, add features we wouldn’t personally use, and it doesn’t have to be pretty. For similar reasons, it’s unlikely that the program or user base would grow, and there seems no need to ever update the code past whatever corrections we may need to make. Finally, assuming we did put out a program as fast as possible, what could go wrong? Depending on what exactly you’re automating, probably not much. Assuming mistakes are limited it’s unlikely anything catastrophic will go wrong.</p>
								
								<p>Now, let’s look at those same factors from the perspective of a software engineer writing a program for a large financial institution. Who is going to be using the program? In our scenario we can assume a sizeable user base with limited tech experience. This means we will need to at the very least sanitize their inputs to make sure they don’t set themselves or something else on fire, add some rigidity so they can’t accidentally take down the building, and whatever other measures we deem appropriate. The program could presumably grow to be pretty large, this piece of software is going to be a staple for our company and will most likely be pushed onto another generation of developers once we’ve run our course and had our souls crushed. They will need to be able to understand at the very minimum what the program does, so it can’t be a massive ball of spiders. Assuming we did go the quick and easy route and pushed it out as soon as humanly possible without regard for human life? Well, we could be fired or potentially sued when a clerk somehow loses all of the transactions for the day by entering something we shouldn’t have let them – we could cost a company millions of rubles in some obscure scenario we failed to account for. </p>
								
								<p>In the real world, things might not be so clear cut – and it’s not strictly one or the other. Sometimes the best option might be a half-measure between the two. In fact, I would recommend you do your own analysis at every level appropriate, there may be parts of a program that can skirt by with a bare minimum while others may require intense testing and safety measures as well as a high degree of organization and factoring. </p>

								<p>While DevOps seems to be a newer movement in software development, it looks to me that a lot of the core principals have been around for some time. Many of what is described here shares quite a bit in common with excerpts from The Mythical Man-Month. “Lean startup” for example was already established pretty well by Frederick P. Brooks Jr. advice to make a project only as large as it needs to be. I would actually be surprised if many (or at least some) of these practices were not already the standard considering many of them were touched on by Brooks Jr. in 1975. </p>
								
								<p>What is surprising to me is the emphasis on the “cloud” which I’ve always figured to be just a silly buzzword for a server, but I suppose it’s starting to stick. I imagine in this case it mostly refers to using products similar to what we’ve been using in class to manage our source code and I can see how something like that would become invaluable for a large team to collaborate and join code plus manage updates and merge. In fact doing it any other way sounds truly awful. </p>
								
								<p>Something that really jumped out at me was the “fail fast” strategy, encouraging people to try different approaches and be a little creative without fear of being penalized. I think that’s really where creativity flourishes. If you are reprimanded for stepping out of line and deviating from the norm you’re never going to try anything new – and if you don’t try anything new then innovation goes out the window.</p>

								<p>Time and time again it seems to be that the largest issue facing programmers is one of planning, scheduling, and communication. As pointed out in the article, there does not seem to be anyone one good solution. While there are some good key practices (such as pointed out in the DevOps article) none of them will prevent every disaster, and I think the best we could hope to aim for is just minimizing the amount of disasters and the damage when they do inevitably occur. </p>
