				<h1>Curtis Michels' CS160 Reading questions!</h1>
				<h2>Dreaming in code:</h2>
				<h3>Overarching Themes:</h3>
				<h4>Pay attention / record the various roles that software engineers have on the Chandler Project.</h4>
			<p><i>Lots of programmers. At least one person doing systems architecture and one researching user behavior.</i></p>
			<h4>Pay attention / record the many scheduling issues related to Chandler Project.</h4>
			<p><i>Trouble getting started, trouble making decisions, trouble making decisions quickly, no clear leadership since it was based on consensus, no deadlines and perhaps a lack of motivation.</i></p>

				<ol start="5" type="1"> <li>People often refer to starting their computer as “booting” their computer. What was the origin of this term?</li>

The second is an “or” gate which will output a voltage if any of its inputs carry a voltage. The third is a “nand” gate, which will output a voltage unless all inputs carry a voltage. Finally we have a “nor” gate, which will output a voltage only if all inputs carry no voltage.</i></p>

								<br>
								<p>There are at least two methods of writing code, both according to this article and my own personal experience. One method of course being the quick and dirty “get it out the door” technique, with the other being a slower yet more robust strategy. I do believe that there is a time and place for each, and which one you should choose depends entirely on the circumstances of your work. </p>
								
								<p>Let’s consider a few different scenarios where we can pick and choose our plan of attack to maximize the strengths of each technique when appropriate. Imagine you’re writing a piece of software for your own personal use. Perhaps it’s something that will automate your work to some extent or just a nifty tool. What should we use and why? To determine that we can look at a number of factors: </p>
								
								<ol start="1" type="1"> <li>Who is going to be using the program? </li>
								<li>How large will the program grow?</li>
								<li>What are our needs for updating/maintaining the code?</li>
								<li>What could go wrong? </li>
								</ol><p>The program is purely for our benefit, so we can presume we’re going to be the only ones using it. This means we don’t need to sanitize our inputs, add features we wouldn’t personally use, and it doesn’t have to be pretty. For similar reasons, it’s unlikely that the program or user base would grow, and there seems no need to ever update the code past whatever corrections we may need to make. Finally, assuming we did put out a program as fast as possible, what could go wrong? Depending on what exactly you’re automating, probably not much. Assuming mistakes are limited it’s unlikely anything catastrophic will go wrong.</p>
								
								<p>Now, let’s look at those same factors from the perspective of a software engineer writing a program for a large financial institution. Who is going to be using the program? In our scenario we can assume a general user with limited tech experience. This means we will need to at the very least sanitize their inputs to make sure they don’t set themselves or something else on fire, add some rigidity so they can’t accidentally take down the building, and whatever other measures we deem appropriate. The program could presumably grow to be pretty large, this piece of software is going to be a staple for our company and will most likely be pushed onto another generation of developers once we’ve run our course and had our souls crushed. They will need to be able to understand at the very minimum what the program does, so it can’t be a massive ball of spiders. Assuming we did go the quick and easy route and pushed it out as soon as humanly possible without regard for human life? Well, we could be fired or potentially sued when a clerk somehow loses all of the transactions for the day by entering something we shouldn’t have let them – we could cost a company millions of rubles in some obscure scenario we failed to account for. </p>
								
								<p>In the real world, things might not be so clear cut – and it’s not strictly one or the other. Sometimes the best option might be a half-measure between the two. In fact, I would recommend you do your own analysis at every level appropriate, there may be parts of a program that can skirt by with a bare minimum while others in that same program may require intense testing and safety measures as well as organization and factoring. </p>
