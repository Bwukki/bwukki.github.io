        		<h1>Curtis Michels' CS160 Reading questions!</h1>
				<h3>Overarching Themes:</h3>
				<h4>Pay attention / record the various roles that software engineers have on the Chandler Project.</h4>
			<p><i>Lots of programmers. At least one person doing systems architecture and one researching user behavior.</i></p>
			<h4>Pay attention / record the many scheduling issues related to Chandler Project.</h4>
			<p><i>Trouble getting started, trouble making decisions, trouble making decisions quickly, no clear leadership since it was based on consensus, no deadlines and perhaps a lack of motivation.</i></p>
				<h3>Specific Chapter Questions:</h3>

				<ol start="15" type="1"> <li>What is the difference between source code and the program you install (.exe) on your computer?</li>
				</ol><p><i>Source code is the human written code used to design the program, with it you can tinker and change things. The .exe on your computer is simply a binary file full of machine code that would be near-impossible for a human to understand.</i></p>

				</ol><p><i>Kind of, it introduced “linus’s law” which says “given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow” and the counter point “Provided the development coordinatior has a communications medium at least as good as the internet, and knows how to lead without coercion, many heads are inevitably better than one.”</i></p>
				
				<ol start="20" type="1"> <li>What was <a href="http://andy.hertzfeld.usesthis.com/">Andy Hertzfeld</a>’s input when the Chandler project appeared to have stalled?</li>

				<p><b>Chapter 2</b></p>
				
				<ol start="1" type="1"> <li>What was the lifetime as a supported product, of Lotus 123? When did Kapor walk away from it? Why did he walk away from it?</li>

				<ol start="4" type="1"> <li>Who, where, when demonstrated one of the first PIM software programs?</li>
				</ol><p><i> “oNLine System” (NLS) – created by Engelbart and demonstrated in 1968 at the San Francisco Convention Center. </i></p>
				
				<ol start="5" type="1"> <li>People often refer to starting their computer as “booting” their computer. What was the origin of this term?</li>
				</ol><p><i>The phrase “pulling oneself up by the bootstraps”</i></p>
				
				<ol start="6" type="1"> <li>Where was the graphical user interface (GUI) developed?</li>

				<a href="http://scribblethink.org/Work/Softestim/softestim.html">http://scribblethink.org/Work/Softestim/softestim.html</a></li>
				</ol><p><i>It may be very difficult to provide an exact objective prediction of the time required to develop a piece of software, but estimation is possible. However, we need to realize our shortcomings and acknowledge that we cannot say for certain and may be way off. </i></p>
				
				<p><b>Chapter 3</b></p>
				
				<ol start="1" type="1"> <li>Keep track of team members: 2001 --&gt; Mitch Kapor, Morgen Sagen, Al Cho, Andy Hertzfeld</li>

				</ol><p><i>He oversaw the tools the programmers would use.</i></p>
				
				<ol start="5" type="1"> <li>What is a “core” dump? Why the use of the word core?</li>
				</ol><p><i>A computer stopping everything its doing and outputting a file of its memory. Because some of the earliest computers were built out of wire coils aka ferrite cores.</i></p>
				
				<ol start="6" type="1"> <li>How did Erik Sink, speaking of abstractions, describe what programmers do?</li>
				</ol><p><i>He described programmers work as building piles of abstractions, designing our own abstractions and then pile them on top of layers we got from somebody else.</i></p>
				
				<ol start="7" type="1"> <li>Rather than writing program statements in binary code, 110101110 1001101111, programmers developed a shorthand language called what?</li>
				</ol><p><i>Assembly language</i></p>
				
				<ol start="8" type="1"> <li>Adding layers of abstraction, new programming languages were created: Lisp, Cobol, Algol, Basic. Fortran was the first widely used. What kind of program converted Fortran to binary?</li>
				</ol><p><i>A compiler.</i></p>
				
				<ol start="9" type="1"> <li>What are the implications behind: “...there is no <a href="http://www.mooreslaw.org/">Moore’s Law</a> for software. Chips may double in capacity every year or two; our brains don’t.”?</li>
				</ol><p><i>The programmer’s time becomes more and more valuable compared to the computer’s processing power. It may not always be worthwhile to be as efficient as possible managing small bits of computational power.</i></p>
				
				<ol start="10" type="1"> <li>The language selected for Chandler was <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a>. What does it mean that Python was an interpreted language?</li>

				<ol start="11" type="1"> <li>The <a href="http://seclists.org/interesting-people/2002/Oct/83">announcement of Chandler</a> occurred when? (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20030504050437/http:/www.riehle.org/vuw-mirror/CS-TR-02-9.pdf">Interesting Paper</a>) <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20021021082601/http:/slashdot.org/">Slashdot page from 2002</a>.</li>

									<div id="readings2" visibility: hidden>
										<p><b>Chapter 4</b></p>
										
										<p>1. What do “front ends” and “back ends” mean to software developers?</p>

										<p>2. What did the Lego Hypothesis refer to?</p>
										
										<p><i>The idea that programs of the future will be built by already created parts and pieces put together like legos.</i></p>
										
										<p>3. Give one reason why the Lego Hypothesis seems to not work so well.</p>
										
										<p><i>Inconsistency with the “building blocks” inside programs makes it difficult to integrate a standard set of blocks.</i></p>
										
										<p><b>Chapter 5</b></p>
										
										<p>1. What is the three-way trade-off that many software projects struggle to overcome.</p>
										
										<p><i>Fast, cheap, or good?</i></p>
										
										<p>2. What is the more recent definition of “geek?”</p>
										
										<p><i>Someone who has an easier time interacting with computers than other humans.</i></p>
										
										<p>3. What does “refactoring” mean to programmers?</p>
										
										<p><i>Rewriting code to make it easier to read, shorter, or more clear.</i></p>
										
										<p>4. What is “yak-shaving?”</p>
										
										<p><i>A seemingly pointless activity which is actually necessary to solve a problem which solves a problem and so on until you solve the real problem you’re working on.</i></p>
